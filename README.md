## Part 3

### 1. 
I would not use a unit test for testing the "message" feature as it involves components interacting with each other on an application level.

### 2.
I would use a unit test for testing the "max message length" as I can just check if the message the user sends is > 80 chars. This should never happen because the program should prevent it.
